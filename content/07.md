Throughout my life, the articulation of my feelings regularly feels incredibly inadequate, often rephrasing sentences mid-conversation in a muddled attempt to express myself truly. Despite my love for poetry, I struggle greatly to replicate its concision and passion without overwhelming my readers with scrapped, nonsensical lines or- to the dismay of my email, birthday post, and essay recipients throughout high school-pages of run-on sentences. However, my Writing 101 class, The Creativity Lab, reintroduced me to a more freeing writing environment that allowed me to explore different methods of communication without intense pressure to impress a college application reviewer. 

As I clawed my way through lecture notes or sprinted across campus to labs, I frequently found myself contemplating the next project for the class: a delirious poem about ice cream and eating disorders or a stream-of-consciousness narrative on mental health. I enjoyed thoroughly fleshing out random ideas to address the liberating yet socially relevant and introspective demands of the class, but the idea for this essay was significantly more difficult. At every assignment, thoughts on my family and culture had goaded me rather persistently, but I mostly ignored addressing it, until being asked to write on my relationship with race. I racked my head over what to say, contemplating what emotional turbulence I would spill by monologue or what brash rebuke I would spit by call to arms. But instead, I cowardly deflected and wrote about my father’s racial insecurities stemming from the Vietnam War. Slowly, that assignment blossomed into a larger project, in which I confronted a lot of misgivings of my culture and sought some sort of confessional relief for both myself and my father. Nonetheless, writing this piece sometimes felt incredibly difficult compared to simply collecting and outlining ideas and devices. Excavating childhood memories and somehow rationalizing them, quite honestly, generated overwhelming dysphoria, and I frequently needed to distance myself from my work and concerned friends. By the work’s conclusion, writing as if I were at peace felt twisted, yet reflecting over and justifying my past perplexingly relieved something just beyond the trauma.

Quietly, this essay has been writing itself since the beginning of Writing 101, and without the incredibly supportive and informative guidance of Nancy Mullenneaux, I would be unable to imagine chasing a truer version of myself so publicly. For all the quirky in-class activities and assignments and all the out-of-class meetups and chats about personal stories and my work, I dedicate an enormous amount of thanks to my Writing 101 professor, Nan. Furthermore, I am forever grateful to Dr. Sheryl Emch and the Thompson Writing Studio for helping me through the final stages of this publication, with fantastic edits that captured my remaining concerns. I also wish to thank my wonderful parents and friends for watching me change and looking out for me as much as they can, each contributing in various ways throughout my life and this writing process. I hope you guys can forgive me. Thank you.
