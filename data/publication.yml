    last_name: Odendahl-James, Ph.D.
    title: Director of Academic Engagement, Arts & Humanities
    affiliation: Academic Advising Center
    bio: Dr. Odendahl-James began her position as DAE in May 2014 after nine previous years at Duke, teaching first in the Thompson Writing Program (courses like Performance Criticism, Documenting Death, Crime Scene Imagination, and Verbatim/Verboten Documentary Theater & Film) and most recently as the resident dramaturg and visiting lecturer in the Department of Theater Studies. I am a professional theater artist who has been making work in the Triangle since 1997 with companies such as Playmakers Repertory Company, Manbites Dog Theater, Little Green Pig Theatrical Concern and Skydive Productions. I have also been the advisor to Duke’s “Me Too Monologues” since 2011. She earned a Master of Fine Arts degree in theater and dance from the University of Texas at Austin, where I founded my own company, Bold Maids Productions. At UT my directing training focused on feminist performance theory and practices with a particular interest in cisgender women, queer and trans* performance artists and playwrights. I earned a doctorate in performance studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. My doctoral research has expanded into a long-term inquiry about embodiment and ethics in documentary performance, particularly those stories that explore traumatic and violent events. That inquiry has led me to another domain of research regarding collaborations between scientists and artists on issues that extend across disciplinary fields and social import, sustainability, genetic engineering, artificial intelligence, mortality, even the nature of matter itself.

    first_name: Julianne  
    last_name: Werlin, Ph.D.
    title: Bacca Foundation Assistant Professor of Rhetoric, Culture and Society
    affiliation: English
    bio: My teaching and research interests include early-modern poetry and prose, literary stylistics, the economics of literature, utopianism, and the sociology of literary forms. My current project, entitled Culture and Bureaucracy, The Rise of Administration and the Transformation of Literature, explores  the effects of the growth of a bureaucratic state on the development of literary styles and genres in early-modern England, looking at issues such as the development of modern English prose; popular culture; literary taste; and literary fame. I'm excited to be part of Duke Visible Thinking because I think it's important to shed light on how deeply integrated research is into learning and teaching at Duke. Undergraduates at Duke are producing fascinating and innovative work all the time, which is too rarely seen by anyone aside from a few professors or classmates. Making this research widely available is a way to draw more members of Duke's community into a shared, and very exciting, intellectual culture.

    title: Associate Professor of the Practice of Electrical and Computer Engineering
    affiliation: Electrical and Computer Engineering
    bio: Dr. Gustafson received a B.S.E. in 1993 from Duke University, majoring in Electrical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science. He continued on at Duke to earn his M.S. (1998) and Ph.D. (1999) in Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science. He received his appointment as Assistant Professor of the Practice of Electrical & Computer Engineering in 2005 and was promoted to Associate Professor of the Practice in 2009. Previously, he has served as Adjunct Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science and as Lecturing Fellow and Assistant Chair of the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department, both at Duke. He also holds a secondary appointment with the Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science Department. Professor Gustafson's primary focus is on undergraduate curriculum and laboratory development. He is responsible for the first-year Computational Methods in Engineering (EGR 103L) course required for all Pratt students, but has also taught seventeen other courses totaling over 70 course offerings and over 5000 students. He previously served as a Lieutenant Commander in the United States Navy as a Naval Reservist, and is authorized to wear the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal (two awards), the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal (two awards), the National Defense Service Medal (two awards), and the Military Outstanding Volunteer Service Medal.

    first_name: Sarah
    last_name: Schott, Ph.D.
    title: Assistant Professor of the Practice 
    affiliation: Mathematics 
    bio: Dr. Schott arrived at Duke in 2006 to pursue a PhD in mathematics, which she earned in 2012, and then immediately began in her current position.  Through teaching, she has gotten to know and work with so many talented students from a variety of different disciplines. In addition to teaching calculus courses, she serves as Associate Director of Undergraduate Studies for her department, and work to encourage more students, especially women, to study mathematics.  She am excited to be on the board of directors for Visible Thinking, because it gives her the opportunity to see what scholastic endeavors Duke students are pursuing beyond the classroom.  She see so many students with a lot of potential and an interest in pursuing research, but an uncertainty about what student research looks like and how to get started.  She believes that Visible Thinking will be powerful in its ability to demystify this process.

    first_name: Luciana   
    last_name: Fellin, Ph.D.
    title: Professor of the Practice of Romance Studies
    affiliation: Romance Studies
    bio: Luciana Fellin is an Associate Professor of the Practice of Italian and Linguistics, Director of the Italian Language Program. She received a Laurea in English and German Literature from the University of Bologna, and a Ph.D. from the University of Arizona where she specialized in sociolinguistics with a dissertation on language socialization practices and dialect revival in Italy. She has taught at the Universities of Trento and Bologna, as well as, San Diego State. My research interests include sociolinguistic aspects of second language learning and teaching as well as the study of language ideologies as linked to language obsolescence, maintenance and revival. She is currently working on an ethnographic project investigating language and identity in Italian American communities which include third, fourth+ generation Italian Americans whose ancestors immigrated to the US in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and Italians who have come to the US in the most recent, 21st century migratory wave. In addition to exquisitely linguistic practices such as code switching and mixing she looks at gesture, prosody and food related symbolic practices and their role in identity construction. Recent discussion of this work can be found in “The Question of Language in the Italian American Experience” in L’Italia allo Specchio, (2015) Finotti, Johnston (Eds.) Venezia Marislio Editore pp. 449-462, and “The Italian new wave, identity work and socialization practices in a community of new Italian immigrants in America.” In Forum Italicum, May 2014 pp. 1-19. Work on language teaching and learning includes “Come insegnare italiano agli oriundi italiani? Il caso degli italo-americani.”, DITALS, edited by Pierangela Diadori, DITALS, vol. 7 (2010), Università per Stranieri di Siena.
